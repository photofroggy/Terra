
		I was never actually intending to release Terra publicly. I only
	changed my mind at around build 60. Terra was intended as a personal
	project to help me learn Python. I really enjoyed everything about
	making this bot, thinking of new new ideas, developing them, handling
	dAmn in the best way I could think of ''without'' using Twisted. The
	only thing I didn't particularly enjoy was writing the documentation
	for the bot, but what's the point of releasing something without the
	documentation?
		Terra is a general purpose bot. You can, in theory, use it to do
	anything you want it to do. The extensions system is very simple, easy
	to use, and very developer friendly. The bot comes with an array of
	extensions, but they are mainly the essentials. The events system is
	simple, yet strong. Events are represented by objects which are passed
	to the methods that handle them.
		If you download Terra, I hope you don't have any difficulties getting
	things going, and I hope you enjoy using it as much as I have enjoyed
	making it.
