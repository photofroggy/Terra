Terra 1 Beta Preview - photofroggy
Acknowledgements

	Terra is a bot developed by myself (photofroggy), alone,
	as a personal project. There have, however, been many people
	who have provided me help, guidance and advice in different
	areas when developing this bot. This is to acknowledge those
	people for their help and advice.
	
	- electricnet
	
		This guy provided inspiration through his own Python bot
		known as Futurism. Simplicity is always key! Unfortunately
		I cannot allow myself to make certain things as simple as he
		does.
	
	- infinity0
	
		Infinity0 has inspired a few small ideas which I have used,
		and discussions with him also inspired the user groups system
		which is used in Terra.
	
	- ManjyomeThunder
	
		He made me lose the game.
		
		
									... bastard.
								
	- philo23
	
		Good ol' Phil! Philo helped me find several bugs by testing
		things out for me. His feedback was invaluable!
	
	- Rhyk and Frozen-Jakalope
	
		These two helped in testing Terra on other operating systems.
		As a result of this they also found some bugs. Thanks!
	
	- Users from #Python on irc.freenode.net
	
		These people helped me in the ways of Python! They are a great
		help, and it is a pleasure to talk to them. Various users were
		really helpful, some of them stuck out. Unfortunately I can't
		specifically remember the people who have helped me in the
		channel, but there are a fair few of them. Thank you very much!
