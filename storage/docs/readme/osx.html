                    <p>
                        Welcome to the Mac OS X setup page! This page details how to get Terra working
                        properly on an Apple computer, using the OS X Operating System.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <p>
                        I can't actually write setup instructions for OS X, as I do not own a Macintosh, and
                        have thus far been unsuccessful in getting help with writing instructions for OS X. All
                        I can tell you is that the Python version that comes with OS X is outdated, and you are
                        required to install Python 3 before running Terra.
                    </p><p>
                        There are disk image files available for Python on OS X on <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/">
                        this website</a>. A disk image is a like an installer for OS X which uses a point and click
                        interface. You can download a disk image of Python 3 from the link below:
                        <code class="block"><a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.1.2/python-3.1.2-macosx10.3-2010-03-24.dmg">
                            Python 3.1.2 OS X Disk Image</a></code>
                    </p><p>
                        Once you have Python 3 installed on your system, setting up Terra should be
                        quite similar to setting up Terra on Linux. Because of this, <a href="linux.html#download_terra">this page</a>
                        may be of some use to you.
                    </p>
