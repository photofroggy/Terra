                    <p>
                        Welcome to the Windows setup page! This page details how to get Terra working
                        properly on a computer using a Windows Operating System (XP, Vista, Windows 7).
                    </p>
                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have tried to make the setup instructions as easy to follow as possible. If you
                        get stuck, feel free to ask someone for help, but keep in mind that you probably shouldn't
                        be using the bot if you can't get it working following the provided instructions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Install Python</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before you can get Terra up and running, you must first install Python. Luckily, this
                        is an incredibly easy thing to do. Just follow the instructions below.
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt><a name="download_an_installer"></a>
                            1 <em>&mdash;</em> Download An Installer</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                The first thing you need to do, is download Python! You need <strong>Python 3.0 or higher</strong>
                                to run this bot! Python 3.1.1 for Windows (32Bit) is available in the link below:
                                <code><a href="http://python.org/ftp/python/3.1.1/python-3.1.1.msi">Python 3.1.1 Windows Installer</a></code>
                            </p><a name="split"></a><p>
                                If you need a different installer, head over to <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/">this page</a> and grab
                                an installer for the latest release of <strong>Python 3</strong>.
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt><a name="run_the_installer"></a>
                            2 <em>&mdash;</em> Run The Installer</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                Now that you have downloaded Python, you need to install it! To install it, simply double click
                                the installer you downloaded, and follow any instructions given to you.
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                    </dl>

                    <h3>Setting Up Terra<em>!</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        If you managed to install Python, you are very close to having your very own copy
                        of Terra up and running! Getting Terra set up properly shouldn't be too difficult, so
                        just follow the instructions below.
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt><a href="download_terra"></a>
                            3 <em>&mdash;</em> Download Terra</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                First thing you need to do is download Terra. If you are reading this file, it is
                                likely that you have already done so, but just incase you haven't, you can get the latest
                                version of Terra at the website linked below:
                            <code><a href="http://www.Botdom.com/wiki/Terra">Terra's Botdom Wiki Page</a></code>
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt><a name="extract_files"></a>
                            4 <em>&mdash;</em> Extract Files</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                Once you have downloaded Terra, you will need to extract the contents of the downloaded
                                file into a folder of your choice.
                            </p><p>
                                To do this, find the file you just downloaded, right click and select <em>"Extract files..."</em>
                                (or <em>"Extract all"</em> depending on which version of Windows you are using).
                            </p><p>
                                Make sure your extract the bot to a folder that is easy to find. Something like <em>"C:\Terra\"</em> will
                                do nicely.
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt><a name="run_terra"></a>
                            5 <em>&mdash;</em> Run Terra</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                When you have completed step 3, go to the folder you extracted Terra to, and run Terra by
                                <strong>double clicking</strong> on the file called <strong>Launch.py</strong>. A black box like the one below
                                should appear on the screen. This black box is Terra itself!
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <img src="http://download.botdom.com/a4jnf/firstrun-win.png" height="377" width="718" alt="Terra First Run (Windows)" />
                    <dl>
                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                The first time you start Terra, you will be required to configure it. To do this, follow the
                                instructions given by the bot itself, in the black window. You are only required to do this
                                the first time your run Terra.
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <h2><a name="congratulations"></a>
                        Congratulations<em>!</em></h2>
                    <p>
                        If everything went correctly, you now have a copy of Terra running on your computer!
                    </p><p>
                        As a final note, double clicking on any of the other files ending in <strong>.py</strong> inside
                        your bot's folder will allow you to do different things. For examle, running <strong>Menu.py</strong>
                        will bring up a main menu, allowing you to pick from a set of options.
                    </p><p>
                        Thanks for reading, and have fun!
