                        Introduction<em>!</em></h2>
                    <p>
                        You can extend the functionality of Terra by creating <em>extensions</em>! There are
                        quite a few extensions included with Terra. Many of these extensions can be found in
                        the folder ~/extensions/OFF. To load them as extensions, simply move them to ~/extensions
                        and restart your bot (if it is already running), or use the command
                        "<a href="System.html#extensions">!extensions reload</a>".
                    </p><p>
                        Extensions are self-contained Python files, these files contain a class, which contains
                        the code for the extension itself. The classes contain methods to handle commands and
                        events. This is part of what makes Terra flexible. Anyone can create an extension to do
                        pretty much anything.
                    </p>
                    <h2><a name="commands"></a>
                        Commands</h2>
                    <p>
                        The main thing that these pages are concerned about are commands. Commands make your bot perform
                        pre-programmed actions, based around what you type. In order to actually use commands, you need
                        to follow a very simple set of rules. Here, I will try to explain these simple rules.
                    </p><p>
                        Fear not! Commands are not difficult things to learn or use!
                    </p>
                    <h3><a name="command_triggers"></a>
                        Triggers</h3>
                    <p>
                        When setting up your bot, you should notice that you are asked for a "trigger". A trigger
                        is a character, or sequence of characters, which are used to tell your bot that you attempting
                        to use a command. Terra requires that you use this trigger in front of any command you try to
                        use.
                    </p><p>
                        For example, if you selected "!" as your trigger, to use the command called "<a href="System.html#about">about</a>",
                        you would need to type "!about" in a dAmn chatroom that your bot is also joined in. Your bot
                        will see that you have sent a message beginning with its trigger, and will try and run the command
                        you have requested.
                    </p><p>
                        In these pages, I am using "!" as the example trigger. When reading, simply replace "!" with your
                        own trigger to get the proper syntax for each command.
                    </p>
                    <h3><a name="command_names"></a>
                        Names</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each command has its own name. Command names have been covered very briefly in the section above.
                        To help make it easier to recognise what the name of a command is, command names are shown in these
                        pages <var>like this</var>.
                    </p><p>
                        Anything else shown in the command's syntax is either a sub-command, or an optional parameter.
                    </p>
                    <h3><a name="command_parameters"></a>
                        Parameters</h3>
                    <p>
                        Command parameters are also sometimes referred to as "arguments". Parameters usually come <i>after</i>
                        the command's name (and sub-commands, if any). Command parameters are usually shown <b>[inside square
                        brackets]</b>. The words inside the square brackets usually define the <i>name</i> of the parameter.
                    </p><p>
                        Some commands have parameters which are optional, and do not need to be used when running the command.
                        Optional parameters are shown <cite>[like this]</cite>, still inside square brackets.
                    </p><p>
                        As already mentioned, the syntax only shows the name of the parameters. The command description will
                        usually give you an idea of what you need to type instead of the parameter name. When using the command,
                        make sure to not actually include the square brackets around the parameters.
                    </p><p>
                        As an example, the command syntax for the <a href="System.html#extension">extension command</a> is
                        "<b>!<var>extension</var> [extension_name]</b>". The comamnd gives information on the extension you define
                        in the parameter "extension_name", so, to get information about the System extension you would have to
                        type <em>"!extension system"</em>.
                    </p>
                    <h3><a name="command_channel"></a>
                        The <cite>[channel]</cite> Parameter</h3>
                    <p>
                        On these pages, you might see "channel" as the first parameter, and it is usually optional. This means
                        you can give the command an optional chatroom name to use in the command, rather than the name of the chatroom
                        you are using the command from.
                    </p><p>
                        To actually use the first parameter in such a way, you should use the "#chatroom" format for the name
                        of the channel. This tells the bot that you want to define the <em>target channel</em> as the one you have
                        typed.
                    </p><p>
                        As a default, if you do not include the optional channel parameter, the command will use the channel you are
                        using the command from.
                    </p><p>
                        Remember, this is only true if "channel" is the <em>first, optional parameter</em>! If it appears anywhere else,
                        and/or it is not an optional parameter, then it may have a different purpose.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ok! Sorry for making this page so long! I just think that knowing the above should make things
                        easier to understand if you are a newbie!
                    </p><p>
                        Onto the stuff that you need to know! Below is a list of extensions. Click the name of the extension
                        to learn about its commands and features! Even with these pages, the best way to learn how to use
                        the commands, is by using them!
                    </p>
                    <dl class="extlist">
                        <dt>&raquo; <a href="System.html">System</a></dt>
                        <dd>
                            The system extension provides commands that let you take full control of your bot.
                            You can change the bot's trigger, tell the bot what channels to join on startup,
                            and even manage user levels!
                        </dd>
                        <dt>&raquo; <a href="dAmn.html">dAmn</a></dt>
                        <dd>
                            The dAmn extension provides commands that let you make your bot interact with dAmn,
                            and you can view information about the bot's connection to dAmn. This can often be
                            helpful.
