                    <p>
                        Welcome to the Linux setup page! This page details how to get Terra working
                        properly on a computer using a distribution of Linux. This particular guide was
                        written <strong>based on the Ubuntu distribution</strong> of Linux, but the
                        instructions may be similar on other distributions.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have tried to make the setup instructions as easy to follow as possible. If you
                        get stuck, feel free to ask someone for help, but keep in mind that you probably shouldn't
                        be using the bot if you can't get it working following the provided instructions.
                    </p>

                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                Python 3.0 or higher is required to run Terra on Linux. Please note, you should not be required
                                to set up Python 3 as your default Python installation. To install Python 3, open up the terminal
                                and type the following command:
                                <code>sudo apt-get install python3</code>
                            </p><a name="split"></a>
                            <p>
                                This may differ on different distributions of Linux!
                            </p>
                        </dd>

                                Now, you must download Terra. If you are reading this file, it is likely that you have already
                                done so, but just incase you haven't, you can get the latest version of Terra at the website
                                linked below:
                            <code><a href="http://www.Botdom.com/wiki/Terra">Terra's Botdom Wiki Page</a></code>
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt><a name="extract_files"></a>
                            3 <em>&mdash;</em> Extract Files</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                Before you can actually get Terra working, you need to extract the files from the zip file you
                                just downloaded. To do this, use the following command in the terminal:
                                <code>unzip &lt;downloaded file&gt; -d &lt;destination&gt;</code>
                            </p><a name="split"></a>
                            <p>
                                Where <em>&lt;downloaded file&gt;</em> is the full pathname of the file you just downloaded, and
                                <em>&lt;destination&gt;</em> is the directory you want to extract the files to.
                            </p><p>
                                For example, if you downloaded the file to <em>~/Downloads</em> and wanted to extract
                                the files to <em>~/Desktop</em>, then the command may look something like this:
                                <code>unzip ~/Downloads/Terra_1.zip -d ~/Desktop</code>
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt><a name="change_directoy"></a>
                            4 <em>&mdash;</em> Changing Directory</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                Before you can do anything else, it is a good idea to change your working directory to the bot's
                                home folder. To do this, you can type the following command into the terminal:
                                <code>cd &lt;bot folder&gt;</code>
                            </p><a name="split"></a><p>
                                Where <em>&lt;bot folder&gt;</em> is the directory you extracted your files to in <a href="#extract_files">step
                                3</a>, plus the sub-folder <em>Terra</em>. For example, if you extracted your files to <em>~/Desktop</em>,
                                then the command may look something like this:
                                <code>cd ~/Desktop/Terra</code>
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt><a name="run_terra"></a>
                            5 <em>&mdash;</em> Run Terra</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                After you have changed directories to the bot's folder, you can start it up! To do this, you will
                                need to type the following command into your terminal:
                                <code>python3 Launch.py</code>
                            </p><a name="split"></a><p>
                                If everything went according to plan, you should see something similar to the image below.
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <img src="http://download.botdom.com/32na5/firstrun-linux.png" height="490" width="689" alt="Terra First Run (Linux)" /> 
                    <dl>
                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                To complete the setup process, you will have to give Terra the information it asks for. After that,
                                you can run Terra again in the same way, and it won't ask you for anything!
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <h2>Congratulations<em>!</em></h2>
                    <p>
                        If everything went correctly, you now have a copy of Terra running on your computer!
                    </p><p>
                        As a final note, running other files ending in <em>.py</em> the same way you did in <a href="#run_terra">step 5</a>
                        will allow you to do different things. For examle, running <strong>Menu.py</strong>
                        will bring up a main menu, allowing you to pick from a set of options.
                    </p><p>
                        Thanks for reading, and have fun!
