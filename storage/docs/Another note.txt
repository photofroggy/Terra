Terra is a bot in Python using only custom and built-in modules
and functions, meaning you only need to have Python 3.0+ installed
to run this bot, and no extras!

When making the bot, I was trying out new concepts, mainly ones that
were new to me. One concept I have in Terra is the new event system. It's pretty
familiar, but I think it is the first of its kind in a dAmn bot. The
events system is always the basis for the extension system. Extensions
bind their methods to events. This is kept as simple as possible. What
separates the events system found here from other implementations, is the
idea of "rulesets". These are modules which handle the binding, unbinding
and triggering of each event. There is code inside the events system which
is used if there is not appropriate ruleset, but it has allowed me to create
a good way of triggering commands, and will hopefully provide you with better
opportunities if you decide you want more functionality in the bot. There will
be more on rulesets in other files in the ~/storage/docs folder.

Once again, I have designed things to be incredibly simple. If you can't manage
without documentation, then you probably shouldn't be using this bot. There is,
however, some limited documentation, and if you can't get things working, even with
the documentation available, then you deffinitely shouldn't be using this bot.
