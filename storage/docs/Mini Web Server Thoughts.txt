
    Using the existing platform for event rulesets and
    dynamic extension systems, I can create a web server
    that displays pages based on data returned by event
    handlers specific to the web server's events.
    
    Creating a small web server for the bot may produce a lot
    of over-head, but it could be useful, and even be loaded and
    unloaded dynamically.
    
    To make sure everything runs smoothly, the web server would
    have to run in a separate thread. This would allow the bot
    to keep running and responding to dAmn events as required, while
    serving web pages to requests on localhost.
