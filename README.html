                        Before you ask me for help, the best advice I or anyone else can
                        give you is "read". That's all you have to do in most cases. Read
                        the stuff that's available to you, reading can work wonders!
                    </p><p>
                        Terra is a bot in Python using only custom and built-in modules
                        and functions, meaning you only need to have Python 3.0+ installed
                        to run this bot, and no extras!
                    </p><p>
                        Thanks for downloading Terra, I hope you have fun using it!
